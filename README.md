# Translate-English-to-Japanese
This website will eventually be turned into an mobile app but for now, it will use the microphone to listen to the user and use ChatGpt to translate the statement to Japanese

Later on, once the proof of concept is verified, other languages, explanation optimization, customer animated icons, and a proper interface will be added/implemented

This project will use node.js, react, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
